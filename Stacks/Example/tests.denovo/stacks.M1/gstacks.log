Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 667935 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  24573 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (3.7%);
  For the remaining 643362 loci (96.3%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 245.7 bp;
  285747 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (44.4%)
    Mean overlap: 25.8bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 224.2;
  Out of 235937840 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 351.8 reads per locus),
    226362130 were successfuly aligned (95.9%);
  Mean insert length was 229.8, stdev: 32.4 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 643290 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=40.5x, stdev=16.3x, min=6.1x, max=81.3x
  mean number of sites per locus: 240.1
  a consistent phasing was found for 373464 of out 479386 (77.9%) diploid loci needing phasing

gstacks is done.
