Attempted to assemble and align paired-end reads for 1114758 loci:
  0 loci had no or almost no paired-end reads (0.0%);
  43512 loci had paired-end reads that couldn't be assembled into a contig (3.9%);
  For the remaining 1071246 loci (96.1%), a paired-end contig was assembled;
    Average contig size was 244.0 bp;
  503547 paired-end contigs overlapped the forward region (47.0%)
    Mean overlap: 25.4bp; mean size of overlapped loci after merging: 223.4;
  Out of 1027851228 paired-end reads in these loci (mean 914.7 reads per locus),
    979834936 were successfuly aligned (95.3%);
  Mean insert length was 230.8, stdev: 33.3 (based on aligned reads in overlapped loci).

Genotyped 1071182 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=30.9x, stdev=14.9x, min=6.1x, max=83.7x
  mean number of sites per locus: 238.6
  a consistent phasing was found for 2168922 of out 2952134 (73.5%) diploid loci needing phasing
