Reference: Rochette & Catchen (2017), Deriving genotypes from RAD-seq short-read data using Stacks (refered as **"the protocol"** below)

1. Do the steps 1 and 2 of the protocol. At the end you should have the same tree structure as the one of my ```Example/``` folder with your raw data looking like mine in the ```raw/``` folder.

2. Do the step 3 of the protocol. Depending on the technique you used in order to sequenced your samples you can have indexes in addition to your barcodes. If it is the case you should have barcodes files looking like:
```GCATG	ATCACG	T_eul_PS82_313
AACCA	ATCACG	T_eul_PS82_314
CGATC	ATCACG	T_eul_PS82_315
TCGAT	ATCACG	T_eul_PS82_317
TGCAT	ATCACG	T_sco_PS96_229
CAACC	ATCACG	T_loe_PS96_213
```
